\begin{abstract}
We report the first radio interferometric observations of the 1.3 mm emission line of $\rm{{}^{12}}$C$\rm{{}^{16}}O$ in the circumstellar envelope of the M supergiant $\alpha$ Ori.  Observations are made with the CARMA interferometer in the C, D, and E antenna configurations. We obtain excellent  uv-coverage (6 - 27 k$\lambda$) by combining data from all configurations allowing us to trace spatial scales from $0.8\arcsec$ to $4\arcsec$. The high spatial resolution C configuration map shows that the inner S1 shell has asymmetric outflow velocities of -10 km s${}^{-1}$ and +13 km s${}^{-1}$  with respect to the stellar rest frame. We find no evidence  for the outer S2 shell in this configuration and assume that this emission has been resolved out. The S2 shell appears as an extra blueshifted emission component in the D and E configuration maps between -10 km s${}^{-1}$  and -16 km s${}^{-1}$ but we see no trace of it in the redshifted velocity component. We conclude that the S2 shell is highly asymmetric in velocity space. A discrete off-source emission feature is detected at 5$\arcsec$ S-W of  $\alpha$ Ori in all D configuration maps. We image both shells in the combined map (all configurations) revealing their complex and irregular structure. We assign an outer radius of $\sim$5$\arcsec$ to S1 and believe that S2 may extend beyond our field of view of $\sim$12$\arcsec$.

\section{Observations and Data Reduction}

The data were acquired with the 15 element CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy) interferometer which is located at Cedar Flat in eastern California and consists of nine 6.1 m antennas and six 10.4 m antennas. Table 1 summarizes our various tracks of millimeter observations which span the period 2007 May - 2009 November. The observations consist of on source profiles of the $\rm{{}^{12}}$C$\rm{{}^{16}}$O (J=2-1) line in the C, D and E array configurations. The baseline length spans over 30-350 m (C array), 11-150 m (D array) and 8-66 m (E array) providing spatial resolutions of 0.8$\arcsec$, 1.8$\arcsec$ and 4$\arcsec$ respectively at 1.3 mm. 

The receivers were tuned to the $\rm{{}^{12}}$C$\rm{{}^{16}}$O (J=2-1) line which has a rest frequency of 230.53 GHz (1.3 mm). The CARMA correlator takes measurements in three separate bands, each having an upper and lower sideband. One band was set to the low resolution 468 MHz   (with 15 channels) mode to observe continuum emission and was centered on the line. The other two bands were configured with 62 MHz and 31 MHz bandwidth across 63 channels (with a resolution of 1.3 km s$\rm{{}^{-1}}$ and 0.65 km s$\rm{{}^{-1}}$ respectively) and were also centered on the line. The line was measured in the upper sideband in the C and E array and in the lower sideband in the D array.

Bandpass and phase calibration were performed using 3C120 and 0530+135. 0532+075 was used as a secondary phase calibrator to determine the quality of the phase transfer from the primary phase calibrator. The observing sequence was to integrate on the primary phase calibrator for $\sim$ 2.5 minutes, the target for $\sim$ 18 minutes, and the secondary phase calibrator for $\sim$ 2.5 minutes. The cycle was repeated for each track which lasted between $\sim$ 1.5 hours and 5 hours. Absolute flux calibration was carried out using the bandpass and phase calibrators in the continuously updated CARMA flux catalog.

The raw data was initially Hanning smoothed using MIRIAD\footnote{Multichannel Image Reconstruction, Image Analysis and Display, \url{http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/miriad/}} and then exported into FITS format so that it could be analyzed with the CASA\footnote{Common Astronomy Software Applications, \url{http://casa.nrao.edu/}} data reduction package. All calibration and imaging was carried out using CASA. The image cubes  were multi-scale  CLEANed down to the 3.0$\rm{\sigma}$ threshold using natural weighting and were corrected for primary beam attenuation, unless otherwise stated below. The \textit{multiscale} algorithm \citep{rich08} within CASA was set to four unique scales; the largest corresponding to the the largest structures visible in individual channel maps. Each scale was approximately set to three times larger than the preceding scale. 
\section{Results} 

\subsection{Individual Configuration Image Cubes} \label{results1} % Link this label using \ref{results1}

The spectrum for each individual configuration image cube (which are composed of all the individual configuration tracks) can be used to obtain information on the kinematics of both shells. The three spectra are shown in Figure 1 for both the high (0.65 km s${}^{-1}$) and low (1.3 km s${}^{-1}$) resolution data and were created by extracting all emission within a circular area that was centered on the source. The radii for these circular areas were 1$\arcsec$, 4$\arcsec$ and 8$\arcsec$ for the C, D and E array image cubes respectively. The velocity rest frame of the spectra are plotted in the stellar rest frame using a radial velocity of 20.7 km s${}^{-1}$ \citep{harp08}.

The spectrum from the C array image cube has a total line width of $\sim$ 27 km s${}^{-1}$ and is dominated by three features; a blue wing, a red wing and a central emission feature at $\sim$ 0 km s${}^{-1}$. The blue wing of the CO emission profile extends to -12 km s${}^{-1}$ while the red wing extends to +15 km s${}^{-1}$. The spectra from the D and E array image cubes have an additional blue wing emission feature located between -12 km s${}^{-1}$ and -17 km s${}^{-1}$. This emission features appears to have been resolved out by the extended C antenna array which has a maximum scale of $\sim 4.5 \arcsec$. It is detected by the more compact configurations which are much more sensitive to extended emission. The total line width of the D and E array spectra are $\sim$ 31 km s${}^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 30 km s${}^{-1}$ respectively and the profile shape is similar to previous publications (Huggins (1994); Huggins (1987)). In all three spectra the high and low resolution data match very well and verify the existence of the main emission features in the line profiles.

An additional emission component is detected in the D configuration image cube and has been reported by \citet{harp09}. The component is present from $\sim$ -5 km s${}^{-1}$ - +6 km s${}^{-1}$ and has a peak emission at $\sim$ 0 km s${}^{-1}$ with respect to the stellar rest frame which equates to approximately 60$\%$ of the source peak emission.
